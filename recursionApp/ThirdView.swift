It is the point where the problem is small enough to be solved directly.\n\n\(Text("2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case;").bold())\nA change of state means that some data that the algorithm is using is modified.Typically, the data representing our problem gets smaller in some way.\n\n\(Text("3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.").bold())\nThe last law is that the algorithm must call itself. This is the very definition of recursion.")
